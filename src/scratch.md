| Longest Palindromic Substring  |   |   |
| Maximum Subarray  | calculate prefixes, if prefixSum < 0, reset it. Find max of the values outstanding. Simple |   |
| Maximum product subarray| since they can have -ve numbers, keep a track of the min product and max product, calculate which is more based on the current index value. Simple | |
| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  |  use a char Set, sliding window, simple code, use l and r |   |
| Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters | | |
| Longest increasing subsequence  | for every element check for a possibility when you find something greater than that current number. This can be improved by using 2 for loop, <br />for i in range(n-1), -1, -1 <br /> for j in range(i+1, len(nums) <br />if (num[i] < num[j] <br />lis[i] = max(lis[i], 1+lis[j]) | DP |
| Longest common subsequence | this is for 2 strings, use 2D dp to do matching | |
| Longest consecutive subsequence | | |
| Longest repeating character replacement| | |
| minimum window substring | | |
